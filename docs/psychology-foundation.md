# Psychology Foundation for Commitment-Oriented Matching

## Purpose
This document defines evidence-based, non-clinical constructs for a long-term-relationship product. The product should infer **tendencies** and compatibility signals, not diagnose users.

## Research Scope
Reviewed domains:
- Adult attachment dynamics (anxiety/avoidance dimensions)
- Big Five traits and couple outcomes
- Conflict behavior and communication processes
- Longitudinal predictors of relationship stability/satisfaction
- Novelty-seeking vs stability orientation
- Emotion regulation and relationship functioning

## Core Findings

### 1) Adult attachment is best modeled as continuous dimensions
- The ECR/ECR-R framework operationalizes attachment primarily as **anxiety** and **avoidance** dimensions.
- Dimensional scoring is preferable to hard categories for precision and reduced information loss.
- Short forms are available and psychometrically supported (e.g., ECR-G-10; 5 anxiety + 5 avoidance items).

Product implication:
- Use brief, non-clinical, ECR-inspired items.
- Compute internal anxiety/avoidance gradients (0-100), avoid hard "you are X" labels.

### 2) Personality effects are real but moderate; neuroticism is consistently important
- Longitudinal and meta-analytic evidence indicates Big Five traits relate to marital/relationship satisfaction.
- Neuroticism/emotional instability shows especially robust association with lower satisfaction trajectories.
- Personality should be treated as one contributor among many; not deterministic.

Product implication:
- Use concise trait proxies (especially emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness).
- Weight personality signals moderately in matching.

### 3) Conflict process quality is strongly predictive over time
- Observed conflict startup quality and negative affect patterns (e.g., criticism/contempt/defensiveness/withdrawal-like dynamics) predict marital outcomes.
- Interaction style/process variables can outperform static baseline traits in predicting trajectories.

Product implication:
- Capture self-reported conflict tendencies and repair orientation in onboarding.
- Include decision-track prompts that evaluate conflict-repair behavior over time.

### 4) Long-term outcomes are multi-factorial (vulnerability + stress + adaptation)
- Longitudinal reviews support models where enduring vulnerabilities, stress load, and adaptive processes jointly drive outcomes.
- Commitment-related variables and relationship investments are strong predictors of stability (especially in dissolution research).

Product implication:
- Separate model layers:
  - hard constraints (intent/timeline/lifestyle)
  - adaptive process fit (communication, regulation, repair)
  - vulnerability mismatch penalties (high anxiety x high avoidance, etc.)

### 5) Novelty and stability should be balanced, not polarized
- Shared novel/arousing activities are associated with improved relationship quality and reduced boredom.
- Very high sensation/novelty seeking can correlate with lower marital adjustment in some samples.

Product implication:
- Model novelty as a **preference axis** (0-100) and optimize for compatible ranges.
- Encourage planned novelty in decision track while preserving value/lifestyle stability.

### 6) Emotion regulation and constructive communication matter
- Better downregulation of negative emotion during conflict predicts higher concurrent and longitudinal marital satisfaction.
- Communication quality mediates part of this effect.

Product implication:
- Include brief self-report items on regulation/repair habits.
- Score a "regulation readiness" tendency and use it in compatibility + nudges.

## Most Predictive Constructs for Product Use
Ordered by expected utility for long-term compatibility (inference from literature):
1. Relationship intent alignment and commitment readiness
2. Conflict startup/repair tendencies and communication style
3. Attachment anxiety/avoidance gradients
4. Emotion regulation tendencies under stress
5. Lifestyle feasibility constraints (time, geography, family goals)
6. Personality fit (especially emotional stability/agreeableness/conscientiousness)
7. Novelty-vs-stability preference fit

## Short-Form, Non-Clinical Measurement Plan
Use 1-5 Likert items, total onboarding under ~8 minutes.

Recommended brief blocks:
- Intent & constraints: 6-8 items
- Attachment-inspired items: 6 items (3 anxiety, 3 avoidance)
- Conflict/repair style: 4-6 items
- Regulation tendencies: 3-4 items
- Big Five-lite: 5 items (single-item proxies)
- Novelty-stability preference: 2 items

Outputs:
- Continuous internal scores (0-100), with confidence bands where appropriate.
- User-facing text: "current tendencies" and "fit signals," never diagnosis labels.

## Suitability Boundaries (Non-Clinical Product)
- Do not claim clinical assessment, pathology, or treatment effect.
- Do not present attachment results as fixed identity types.
- Use language like "you may tend to..." and "this match may work better when..."
- Offer reflective prompts and behavior experiments, not diagnostic judgments.
